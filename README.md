- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FreeMarketKids
- Free Market Kids creates first principle games, e.g., the Bitcoin mining game, HODL UP.
- We have incorporated a non-profit called FREE AND OPEN SOURCE EDUCATION (FOSE) FOUNDATION, www.fosefoundation.org.
- FOSE transforms proven educational games from the physical to the digital, literally expanding their impact to the whole world.
- Free Market Kids has given FOSE FOUNDATION license to use the DIGITAL VERSIONS of our games.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in funding the minimum viable product (MVP) of DIGITAL HODL UP through FOSE.
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: We also have a Lightning game (CHANNEL UP), a seed phrase game (BIP39), and others in the development pipeline.

- ðŸ˜„ Happy Hodling!
